    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crepes are a beloved and versatile French dish known for their thin, 
        delicate, and paper-thin pancake-like appearance. 
        These elegant creations originate from the Brittany region of France 
        but have gained worldwide popularity for their ability to be both sweet and savory, 
        making them a favorite for breakfast, brunch, dessert, or even a light meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar (optional)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Batter: Combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, and, for sweet crepes, 1-2 tablespoons of sugar. In another bowl, whisk 2-3 eggs with 1 1/2 cups of milk until smooth. Slowly add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients while whisking until a smooth batter forms. Optionally, whisk in 2 tablespoons of melted butter and let the batter rest for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the Pan: Place a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil, spreading it evenly with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Cook the Crepes: Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the hot pan, quickly spreading it thinly across the bottom. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges brown and the surface dries.</li>
            <li>Flip and Fill: Gently flip the crepe with a spatula and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes. If making savory crepes, add fillings to one half while in the pan. For sweet crepes, add toppings like Nutella or fruit.</li>
            <li>Serve: Fold the crepe in half over the fillings or toppings and transfer it to a plate. Continue making crepes with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil as needed. Serve warm, folded or rolled, with additional toppings or sauces if desired.</li>
