            <li>Ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the Lasagna Noodles: Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain them and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium-high heat until it's browned and cooked through. Add diced onions and minced garlic, and cook until they become soft and translucent. Then, stir in crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh basil. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes to let the flavors meld together.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Cheese Filling: In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and beaten eggs. Mix well to create a creamy cheese filling.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually around 350°F or 175°C). In a large baking dish, start assembling the lasagna layers. Begin with a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of cooked lasagna noodles, then a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, and finally, a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering process until your dish is filled or you run out of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake: Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 30-35 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Rest and Serve: Once out of the oven, let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set and makes it easier to serve. Garnish with fresh basil or more grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
